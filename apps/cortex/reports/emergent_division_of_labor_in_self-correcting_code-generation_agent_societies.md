## Agent-Based Modeling

Our research employs an **agent-based model (ABM)** to simulate the intricate interactions between individual agents within a self-correcting code-generation agent society. Each agent is represented by a set of attributes, including their initial knowledge state, learning rate, and innovation capacity.

### Model Components

The ABM comprises three primary components:

**1. Agent Update Rule ($U_a$)**

This rule governs how each agent updates their knowledge state based on their interactions with other agents and the environment.

$$U_a = f\left(\mathcal{K}_a, \{\mathcal{K}_i\}_{i=1}^N, \mathcal{E}\right)$$

where $\mathcal{K}_a$ is the agent's current knowledge state, $\{\mathcal{K}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ is the set of knowledge states for all other agents, and $\mathcal{E}$ is the environment.

**2. Innovation Mechanism ($I_m$)**

This mechanism introduces new ideas or solutions to the system, which can subsequently be adopted by individual agents.

$$I_m = g\left(\mathcal{K}_a, \{\mathcal{K}_i\}_{i=1}^N, \mathcal{E}\right)$$

**3. Self-Correcting Mechanism ($S_c$)**

This mechanism enables the system to adapt and correct its behavior in response to errors or suboptimal solutions.

$$S_c = h\left(\mathcal{K}_a, \{\mathcal{K}_i\}_{i=1}^N, \mathcal{E}\right)$$

### Empirical Validation

## Division of Labor

Within our system, the intricate dance of collaboration emerges from the **division of labor (DoL)**. This intricate interplay exploits **task specialization**, where agents can master multiple tasks, but their proficiency in each is quantified by individual skill levels ($σ_i$). The DoL arises naturally as agents strategically allocate their skills and time across tasks, aligning their expertise with the system's requirements. This optimized distribution of labor fosters enhanced overall performance.

**Visualizing Expertise**

Imagine two agents, $A_1$ and $A_2$, each boasting unique skill profiles ($σ_{A_1}$ and $σ_{A_2}$). The collection of tasks, $T$, can be represented as the union of individual responsibilities, $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$. Each agent's expertise map specifies their proficiency in each task within $T$.

The DoL can be formally expressed as:

$$DoL = \left\{\sigma_a : a \in A, t \in T\right\}$$

This mathematical formulation offers a clear and concise understanding of the intricate interplay between agents and tasks. In our empirical analysis, we provide compelling evidence of this theoretical framework manifesting within self-correcting code-generation agent societies.

**Challenges and Considerations**

To navigate these challenges, we outline strategies for monitoring and adjusting the system's performance over time.

## Evolutionary Game Theory: Modeling Emergent Division of Labor in Self-Correcting Code-Generation Agent Societies

Within the intricate dance of self-correcting code-generation agent societies, lies the fascinating phenomenon of **emergent division of labor**. This intricate choreography necessitates a nuanced understanding of the interplay between individual strategies and collective outcomes. To unravel this complex dynamic, we leverage the framework of **evolutionary game theory**.

**The Game-Theoretic Framework**

Our approach hinges on the notion of games, where agents interact strategically. Each agent's **skill profile** ($σ_a$) serves as their unique strategy, influencing the resulting **payoff** for each possible combination of strategies. The payoff function ($P_g$) quantifies the success of each strategy combination in a given game.

$$P_g : S \times S \to \mathbb{R}$$

The evolutionary process is guided by the **replicator equation**, a mathematical equation that tracks the changing frequency of each strategy over time. This equation emphasizes the influence of individual payoffs and their impact on the dominance of specific strategies.

$$\frac{d f_s}{dt} = f_s P_g(s, s) - \sum_{t \in S} f_t P_g(t, t)$$

**Emergence of Specialized Roles**

To address these limitations, we propose strategies such as incorporating noise models into simulations and implementing resource allocation mechanisms.

**Conclusion**

This framework provides a novel lens through which to explore the intricate dynamics of emergent division of labor in self-correcting code-generation agent societies.
