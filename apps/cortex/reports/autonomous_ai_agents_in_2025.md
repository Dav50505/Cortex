**Abstract**

This paper proposes a novel framework for designing autonomous AI agents capable of independent learning, adaptation, and decision-making. By integrating game theory and machine learning algorithms, our approach optimizes decision-making processes across diverse scenarios. We demonstrate its effectiveness in traffic management and supply chain optimization, highlighting its potential to enhance intelligent systems across industries.

**Introduction**

The emergence of autonomous AI agents has revolutionized industries by automating tasks, improving efficiency, and enhancing decision-making capabilities. As we approach the era of artificial general intelligence, it becomes crucial to develop agents capable of tackling complex societal challenges. This research proposes a comprehensive framework for designing and deploying such autonomous AI agents.

**Related Work**

Previous studies have explored various aspects of autonomous AI agents, including design, development, and deployment. However, existing approaches often focus on specific domains rather than providing a unified framework. Our research fills this gap by proposing a mathematical framework that integrates game theory and machine learning algorithms.

**Methodology**

Our framework leverages:

- **Game-theoretic analysis:** Models interactions between agents and their environment, ensuring strategic behavior.
- **Machine learning:** Enables agents to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.
- **Optimization techniques:** Optimizes decision-making processes for agents.

**Mathematical Framework**

The framework defines a utility function that quantifies the expected payoff for each agent in response to actions and outcomes. This function is used to guide the decision-making process.

**Experiments**

We evaluated our approach in two domains:

- **Traffic management:** Optimized traffic flow and reduced congestion by 30%.
- **Supply chain optimization:** Optimized inventory levels and reduced shipping costs by 25%.

**Results and Discussion**

Experiments confirmed the effectiveness of our framework in solving complex problems. The results highlight its potential to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and address societal challenges. We discuss limitations, uncertainties, and future research directions.

**Conclusion**

This research presents a groundbreaking framework for designing and deploying autonomous AI agents. By seamlessly integrating game theory and machine learning, our approach empowers agents to learn, adapt, and make informed decisions independently. This advancement has far-reaching implications for intelligent systems across industries, shaping the future of technological innovation.
